## ABOUT THE APP
App to compare stock performance based on the day of the week for any timeframe. It offers four windows to choose a stock ticker, start date, and end date. Once you hit retrieve, it generates a table with performance data based on the day of the week, along with the option to show/hide price data for every day of the timeframe.
